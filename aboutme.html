  <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Julia Knoblock ("knob" and "lock" - think of a door) I'm 27 years old and am currently pursuing my interest in front-end web development. Since I was a teenager, I've experimented here and there with coding but never recieved any formal training. Now that I'm learning the "pro" way of doing things, I can't pull myself away. Every little bump I encounter is nearly impossible to ignore until I've overcome it. </p>
<p>Someday I hope to pursure front-end web development as a freelance designer. I've spent years trying to figure out what I would be happy with doing day in and day out, and I think I've found it.</p>
<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
<p>I'm a rare native San Diegean - born and raised. I say "rare" because more often than not, people come here. There are not many of us who are lucky enough to have been born in such a wonderful laid-back city (and beer capital of the world, I might add).  I spent one year living in Los Angeles and quickly decided to come back. There is no leaving San Diego!</p>
<h1>More About Me</h1>
<h2>What Are Your Favorite Hobbies?</h2>
<p>I'm sure you've heard of the "crazy cat lady." I'm the crazy <i>bunny</i> lady. Yes, we do exist and rabbits actually make great indoor pets. Did you know that in this country, rabbits are the third most popular pet but the first most neglected? Because of this, I'm heavily involved with rabbit rescue groups and spend 3-4 days of the week volunteering with the local humane
    society and educating the public about responsible rabbit care. I currently have a house full of rescued rabbits and they all live lazy, healthy, and quiet lives. This is one of my boys, Alejandro. He is a 5 year old dutch bunny bonded with his sister.

  <h2>What's Your Dream Job?</h2>
  <p>My dream job would definitely involve me working at home. I'm a homebody and taking care of multiple rabbits almost requires me to be at their service all day (rabbits have slaves - I'm their slave). These are big reasons why I'm furthering my educating in front end web development - someday
    I hope to be a freelance developer working from home.</p>
    <h2>What's Your Background?</h2>
    <p>I self-taught myself bits and pieces of HTML about ten years ago. I would spend hours tinkering with code and making silly websites. As life started to get in the way, I lost touch with that passion and am finally rediscovering it. </p>
    <h2>What Music Have You Been Listening to Lately?</h2>
    <p>Lately? I'm very loyal (okay, maybe boring) when it comes to music. Since I was 9, I've been a die-hard Britney Spears fan (don't laugh, I love her!) Other than Britney, I'm a proud supporter of Fall Out Boy. My taste in music is a bit outdated...but
    I enjoy it!
